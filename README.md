# Instructions to use:
# index.html contains all html and js code
# styling is saved in the Styles.css code
# .glb file is used to mode display

# will function like any other website plug in the index.html file as well as the Styles.css to where ever you would host
# the website and it should work

# currently hosted on github under the url:
# https://brycecooperkawa.github.io/vwAdmin/

# after the end of the 2023 fall semester the databases this panel are connected to will likely be shut down
# if using after this, probably need to adjust the links in the js code
